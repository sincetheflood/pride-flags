Pride Flags
===========

A mildly opinionated collection of handwritten pride flags available in the public domain.

All flags are available as both SVGs and PNGs inside the `flags/` directory and are split up by gender and orientation.  Templates to ease the creation of new flags are available inside the `templates/` directory.

The PNG flags are created by converting the SVG files to PNGs using [librsvg](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg) and then compressed using [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng).
